excerpt: |
    One thing that has always bothered me is how difficult it is to easily deploy database changes with your application updates. The classic approach is to use a tool such as Red Gate SQL Compare to determine the differences in the schemas between your testing and production environments and create a DDL script to manually deploy. If you have data changes, you&#39;ll either need to keep track manually (error prone) or use a tool like Red Gate SQL Data. Even with the costly tools you can still have issues that require human interaction, which adds a ton of "ceremony" to your deployments. To have a fluid Continuous Integration environment, you must find a way to tackle this issue.
