	BarCamp Cedar Valley was February 1 at the UNI campus. This was the third event we've put on and was by far my favorite. If you haven't
	attended a BarCamp and are interested, I would recommend following <a href="https://twitter.com/barcampcv" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a> to keep up
	with the latest information. If you curious about what BarCamp is all about, I would suggest reading
	<a href="http://barcampcv.com/Home/About" target="blank">What Is Barcamp?</a> from our website.
</p>
<h2>Planning The Event</h2>
<p>
	I'm lucky to be part of a great leadership group that helps plan this event. Like I mentioned, this was our third event so we've worked
	out a lot of the kinks. We didn't have any locked door, no lights, or lost reservation incidents like previous BarCamps. One of the things
	we really needed to tackle this time was making our <a href="http://barcampcv.com" target="_blank">website</a> mobile-friendly. When we originally created
	it we found a cheap WordPress theme and it was dated and didn't work at all on mobile.
</p>
<p>
	To do this, I used <a href="http://www.initializr.com/" target="_blank">Initializr</a> to create a solid website base, integrated it into an
	<a href="https://github.com/FarReach/BarCampCV" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> project, found a basic theme on
	<a href="http://startbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">http://startbootstrap.com/</a>, and pulled it all together. The site was mostly
	responsive but there were a few minor issues. Thanks to <a href="http://www.farreachinc.com" target="_blank">Far Reach</a> for hosting our site.
	While it was fun to pull all these items together, it really was overkill for what we needed and next time I think next time I'll just
	throw together a site on <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> using one of their built-in templates.
</p>
<p>
	I'm always impressed with the level of financial support from area businesses to sponsor events like these. Among our great sponsors this
	year were <a href="http://www.farreachinc.com" target="_blank">Far Reach</a>, <a href="http://www.uniincubator.com/" target="_blank">
	UNI Innovation Incubator</a>, <a href="http://kyoger.com/" target="_blank">Kyoger</a>, <a href="https://www.veridiancu.org/" target="_blank">Veridian</a>,
	<a href="http://vgmforbin.com" target="_blank">VGM Forbin</a>, <a href="http://vlgux.com/" target="_blank">Visual Logic Group</a>,
	<a href="http://www.strategic-imaging.com/" target="_blank">Strategic Imaging</a>, and
	<a href="http://cedarvalleyalliance.com/" target="_blank">Greater Cedar Valley Alliance & Chamber</a>. It really takes a load off the
	organizers' backs when great supporters such as these step up to help. Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p>
	Another thing we were concerned about was attendance numbers. Our first event in 2013 was wildly successful, drawing in over 100 attendees.
	We had great feedback from the event, so much so that we decided to do another event in the fall of 2013. Unfortunately the 2nd event
	only drew less than 40 attendees, and we were leery of doing another event. We (obviously) decided to plan a 2014 event, hoping to
	capitalize on everybody's cabin fever. We definitely made the right choice as we had over 60 attendees even in the poor weather
	conditions. I think we're planning on maintaining a yearly event every February.
</p>
<h2>My Talk: Recharging Your Battery - Avoiding Tech Burnout</h2>
<p>
	Since the tech track was slow to fill, I decided to do a talk about burnout as I was currently feeling a little burnt out. It was the first
	talk of the day and there was a great crowd. I led with things I do to recharge my battery, including charity work, working with the
	community, and attending events. The crowd took over the conversation (which is what I was hoping for) and there was a good discussion
	about work-life balance. One great suggestion that I need to do is to write every pending issue and work item on a list and leave
	it at my desk every night. I'm hoping that this approach cuts down on my stress at night and helps me to focus on my family.
</p>
<p>
	In my talk I mentioned a great presentation by <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor" target="_blank">Cory House</a> from
	<a href="http://www.iowacodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Iowa Code Camp</a> on being an outlier in your career. After seeing this
	presentation I was definitely inspired to shake myself out the negative funk I was currently in. Just this week
	I saw that Cory is developing a video training session on the same topic for
	<a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> due to be released in April, so I recommend keeping your
	eyes on that.
</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>
	As mentioned before, I'm going to try doing a brain dump to a list at the end of each workday. I'm hoping this cuts down on me sitting
	around worrying at nights about impending deadlines, challenges, or other work-related stress. I also learned about a new area user group:
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CedarValleyMakers/" target="_blank">Cedar Valley Makers.</a> I need to check out a meeting sometime.
</p>
<p>
	I was very please to learn that <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_s" target="_blank">Kevin Shannon</a> was working on a charity hackathon
	in the Des Moines area. I shared some ideas from our <a href="http://a.pgtb.me/65Z6Qb" target="_blank">Operation: Make A Difference</a>
	initiative at work. I hope what he's planning works out for my schedule because I'd definitely like to participate.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
	I'm not sure exactly why, but this BarCamp was my favorite so far. I was lucky to meet Kyoger people
	<a href="https://twitter.com/trevorcarlson4" target="_blank">Trevor Carlson</a> and
	<a href="https://twitter.com/tracesteffen" target="_blank">Trace Steffen</a>. I was able to catch up with
	<a href="https://twitter.com/zpeverman" target="_blank">Zach Everman</a> and
	<a href="https://twitter.com/jaymief" target="_blank">Jaymie Feldman</a>. There were few issues other than delayed t-shirt delivery and trying to
	transport nine platters of Pita Pit food by myself in my truck on rough roads. I'm really looking forward to next year's event. If
	you'd like any info on BarCamp or are interested in helping coordinate, sponsor, or speak at a future BarCamp I encourage you to
	reach out for information.
