I wrote a guest blog post for <a href="http://www.outlierdeveloper.com" target="_blank">outlierdeveloper.com</a> entitled <a href="http://www.outlierdeveloper.com/job-jumping-four-tips-for-todays-market/" target="_blank">Job Jumping: Four Tips for Today's Market</a>. This post tries to summarize what I've done wrong that has led me on a turbulent path in my career. I'd encourage you to check out the rest of the content on that site, as well as Cory House's course on <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/career-reboot-for-developer-mind" target="_blank">becoming an outlier developer</a> on Pluralsight.
