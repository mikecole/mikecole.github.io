<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I am a software developer living and working in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Primarily a Microsoft stack developer, I am experienced in technologies
	such as ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI, C#, SQL Server, and Azure. I am also familiar with popular JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, React,
	and Knockout. I am a constant learner and always have my eyes open for new technologies I can add to my toolbox.
</p>
<p>
	One of my favorite things about what I do is being able to participate in the community. I have been an officer in our
	local <a href="http://cvineta.org" target="_blank">CVINETA</a> user group since 2009. I have also been involved with planning and executing
	the <a href="http://barcampcv.com" target="_blank">BarCamp Cedar Valley</a> yearly event since 2013. I am available to speak at your event;
	please see my <a href="/speaking">Speaking</a> page for details.
</p>
<p>
	I am the father of two beautiful children and husband to my lovely wife. I like to hunt, fish occasionally, play blackjack,
	play video games, goof around, and watch Iowa Hawkeye athletics.
