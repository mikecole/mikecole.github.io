<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I am a software developer living and working in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Primarily a .NET developer, I am skilled in a variety
	of Microsoft technologies including ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, ASP.NET WebForms, Silverlight, and WPF. I have over ten
	years of professional development experience in many different industries.
</p>
<p>
	One of my favorite things about what I do is being able to participate in the community. I have been an officer in our
	local <a href="http://cvineta.org" target="_blank">CVINETA</a> user group since 2009. I have also been involved with planning and executing
	the <a href="http://barcampcv.com" target="_blank">BarCamp Cedar Valley</a> yearly event since 2013. I am available to speak at your event;
	please see my <a href="/speaking">Speaking</a> page for details.

<p>
	I am the father of two beautiful children and husband to my lovely wife. I like to hunt, fish occasionally, play blackjack,
	play video games, goof around, and watch Iowa Hawkeye athletics.
