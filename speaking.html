	<h2>Going The Extra Mile with Entity Framework Code First</h2>
	<p>
		Entity Framework Code First is a breeze to get up and running, but are you taking advantage of some of the more advanced features? Are you getting caught up by common pitfalls? In this presentation, we'll review the history of Entity Framework and the status of the project. We'll cover some core functionality concepts and asynchronous queries. Mike will show how to use StructureMap to easily maintain the lifetime of the DataContext. We'll look at how we can leverage the Projection functionality of AutoMapper to easily write optimized queries. Finally, Mike will demonstrate EF Migrations and how you can tie it into your current continuous integration environment. This presentation assumes you have some knowledge of Entity Framework so we'll try to not get caught up in the basics.

	<h2>Repository Pattern in ASP.NET</h2
	<p>	
		How do you do data access in your ASP.NET web applications? The number of choices can be staggering: ADO.NET, Entity Framework,
		Massive, Dapper, etc. etc. etc. Even when you chose a technology, what kind of architecture pattern will you use for the highest
		flexibility and lowest amount of friction?
	</p>
	<p>
		In this presentation, Mike will show you a tried-and-true data access strategy. He’ll focus on using the Entity Framework ORM with
		the Repository Pattern to create a powerful data access layer. He’ll use an Inversion of Control tool to decouple our data access
		from the rest of our application. He'll show tips and tricks on how to create highly optimized database queries.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we’re done, you should be able to set up a simple Repository Pattern on your own, and you’ll have an example ASP.NET MVC
		project that you can use to try to become a data access guru!
