	<h2>Going The Extra Mile with Entity Framework Code First</h2>
	<p>
		Entity Framework Code First is a breeze to get up and running, but are you taking advantage of some of the more advanced features?
		Are you getting caught up by common pitfalls? In this presentation, we'll review the history of Entity Framework and the status of the
		project. We'll cover some core functionality concepts and asynchronous queries. Mike will show how to use StructureMap to easily maintain
		the lifetime of the DataContext. We'll look at how we can leverage the Projection functionality of AutoMapper to easily write optimized
		queries. Finally, Mike will demonstrate EF Migrations and how you can tie it into your current continuous integration environment.
		This presentation assumes you have some knowledge of Entity Framework so we'll try to not get caught up in the basics.

	<h2>TypeScript for the .NET Developer</h2>
	<p>
		Are you an ASP.NET developer that's looking to embrace JavaScript but just can't get the hang of it? So was I! In this presentation
		I'll show you how to can start using TypeScript to keep your application easily refactorable using your familiar tools. I'll show you
		how you can use the DefinitelyTyped repository to utilize TypeScript with third party plugins such as Angular or Knockout. Finally, I'll
		show you how to use TypeLITE to help leverage reuse of your .NET models in JavaScript. All of these tools are free and they'll definitely
		make you feel more at home in the JavaScript world.

	<h2>Password Security and You - How to Protect Yourself in a Horrible E-World</h2>
	<p>
		This talk would cover tips on how to keep yourself safe on the internet. It would review basic password security tips,

	<h2>Repository Pattern in ASP.NET</h2
	<p>	
		How do you do data access in your ASP.NET web applications? The number of choices can be staggering: ADO.NET, Entity Framework,
		Massive, Dapper, etc. etc. etc. Even when you chose a technology, what kind of architecture pattern will you use for the highest
		flexibility and lowest amount of friction?
	</p>
	<p>
		In this presentation, Mike will show you a tried-and-true data access strategy. He’ll focus on using the Entity Framework ORM with
		the Repository Pattern to create a powerful data access layer. He’ll use an Inversion of Control tool to decouple our data access
		from the rest of our application. He'll show tips and tricks on how to create highly optimized database queries.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we’re done, you should be able to set up a simple Repository Pattern on your own, and you’ll have an example ASP.NET MVC
		project that you can use to try to become a data access guru!
