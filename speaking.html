	I am available to speak at your events! Here's a list of talks I have prepared and I do take requests. Please contact me
	if interested.
</p>
<p>
	<h2>Detailed Entity Framework Migrations (In Progress)</h2>
	<p>
		This talk would go into details on Entity Framework Migrations, and would show how to achieve continuous integration without
		having to deal with SQL scripts.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<h2>Going The Extra Mile with Entity Framework Code First</h2>
	<p>
		Entity Framework Code First is a breeze to get up and running, but are you taking advantage of some of the more advanced
		features? In this presentation I'll show you tips on how to optimize your queries. I'll show you how to get better control
		of how Entity Framework generates your database. I'll demonstrate how to easily get started with Code First when you have an
		existing database. I'll show how to easily implement row auditing and how to handle concurrency. Finally, I'll give you a quick
		primer on Code First Migrations and how you can utilize this framework to version your database changes to achieve continuous
		integration.
	</p>

	<h2>Repository Pattern in ASP.NET</h2
	<p>	
		How do you do data access in your ASP.NET web applications? The number of choices can be staggering: ADO.NET, Entity Framework,
		Massive, Dapper, etc. etc. etc. Even when you chose a technology, what kind of architecture pattern will you use for the highest
		flexibility and lowest amount of friction?
	</p>
	<p>
		In this presentation, Mike will show you a tried-and-true data access strategy. He’ll focus on using the Entity Framework ORM with
		the Repository Pattern to create a powerful data access layer. He’ll use an Inversion of Control tool to decouple our data access
		from the rest of our application. He'll show tips and tricks on how to create highly optimized database queries.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we’re done, you should be able to set up a simple Repository Pattern on your own, and you’ll have an example ASP.NET MVC
		project that you can use to try to become a data access guru!
